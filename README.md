This projects is developed for the KrackHack Hackathon it enables real-time traffic object detection from any live-streamed video, including YouTube live feeds. Using YOLOv8 for object detection, a Flask backend, and OpenCV for frame processing, it efficiently detects vehicles and pedestrians. The frontend provides a live dashboard to visualize detections in real time. Optimized for performance without FFmpeg, it achieves ~82% mAP and ~30 FPS, making it a scalable solution for traffic monitoring and smart city applications.
It is trained over 50k images using BDD100K dataset as of now.

The dataset mainly consisted of cars so it gives a greater accuracy for that.
